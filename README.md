# Luno Go SDK Examples

## Getting started

1. Create an API key through the [Luno website](https://www.luno.com/wallet/security/api_keys).

2. Copy the **Secret** into a file.
   By default these examples will look for a `secret` file in the root directory of the project.

3. `go run` examples with the flag `--key=<Your API Key>`.
